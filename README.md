# German-Traffic-Sign-Classification
This project aims to bring out an in depth comparison among existing image classification models on German Traffic Sign benchmark (GTSRB) images. In this project famous machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVMs, MLPs etc. and deep learning models like ResNet and CNNs have been implemented. Apart from this we also employed ensemble learning algorithm like Random Forest to get clear comparsion based on evaluation metrics like ROC Curves, Precision, Accuracies etc. Transfer Learning has also been implemented by extracting features of CNN and using them in other models.
